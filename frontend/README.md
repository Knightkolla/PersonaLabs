# Persona Labs

**Accelerate launches with AI audience simulations.**

Persona Labs is a web application that helps you test product-market fit and refine messaging before spending a dollar on marketing. By simulating how different AI personas would react to your ideas, content, or products, you can gain valuable insights into audience reception and optimize your approach.

## What It Does

### 🎯 **Society Simulation**
- Create custom AI persona networks based on your target audience
- Choose the number of personas (3, 5, 8, 10, or 15) to simulate
- Define your society with descriptions like "Entrepreneurs in Bangalore" or "Gen Z creators in LA"

### 🤖 **AI Persona Network**
- Each persona is based on detailed profiles with unique backgrounds, personalities, and communication styles
- Personas include demographics, education, experience, values, and social influence levels
- Interactive network visualization shows how personas are interconnected

### 💬 **Content Testing**
Test various scenarios with your persona network:
- "Would this post resonate with LinkedIn founders?"
- "Will my YouTube video idea click?"
- "Pitching an AI tool — would investors care?"
- "Would this meme flop or fly on Twitter?"
- "Launching a new app — how would Reddit react?"

### 📊 **Comprehensive Analytics**
After running simulations, get detailed insights including:
- **Impact Score**: Overall effectiveness rating (0-100)
- **Engagement Breakdown**: High, moderate, and low interest percentages
